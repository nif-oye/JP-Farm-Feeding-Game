This project is a fun and interactive game created as part of the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer). In this game, players are responsible for feeding hungry dogs that appear randomly opposite the player. It‚Äôs a great exercise in working with colliders, spawn managers, and other foundational Unity concepts.

## Features

- **Dog Feeding Mechanic:** Press the space bar to launch food projectiles toward hungry dogs that spawn.
- **Dynamic Dog Spawning:** Dogs appear at random locations on the farm.
- **Smart Collider Interactions:** Unity colliders are used to detect when food reaches a dog. Additionally, colliders help manage and remove excess dog clones, ensuring optimal game performance.

## Learning Objectives

- Implementing colliders for interactive game mechanics
- Using spawn managers to control object spawning
- Practicing basic C# scripting and Unity scene management
